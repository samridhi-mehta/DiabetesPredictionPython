# Diabetes Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis
The Diabetes Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis project involves analyzing a dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and key risk factors associated with diabetes, helping in data-driven healthcare decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to analyze diabetes-related data to uncover patterns, correlations, and key risk factors that contribute to diabetes prediction. The insights derived from this analysis can help in developing better preventive strategies and aiding medical professionals in decision-making.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis consists of patient medical records, containing several health indicators related to diabetes risk. The key attributes include:
- **Pregnancies** – Number of times a patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose** – Blood glucose concentration (mg/dL).
- **Blood Pressure** – Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **Skin Thickness** – Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin** – 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI** – Body Mass Index (kg/m²), indicating obesity level.
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function** – A measure of genetic predisposition to diabetes.
- **Age** – Age of the patient (years).
- **Outcome** – Binary variable (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic).

The dataset is sourced from healthcare records and contains both numerical and categorical variables that help in identifying diabetes risk factors.

## Data Preprocessing
To ensure a high-quality dataset for analysis, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

### 1. Handling Missing Values
- Some values (e.g., glucose, insulin, BMI) contained **zero values**, which are biologically implausible.
- These missing or incorrect values were **imputed using median values** or removed based on domain knowledge.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Checked for **duplicate records** and ensured data integrity.
- Standardized numerical values for consistency.

### 3. Feature Scaling & Normalization
- Since the dataset contains attributes with different ranges, **min-max scaling** was applied where necessary.
- **Standardization** was performed for machine learning compatibility in potential predictive modeling.

### 4. Outlier Detection
- Used **box plots and histograms** to identify potential outliers.
- Outliers were either removed or transformed using **log normalization** where necessary.

### 5. Data Balancing (if required)
- Since the dataset might be imbalanced (more non-diabetic than diabetic cases), **oversampling/undersampling techniques** were considered for predictive modeling.

## Approach & KPI Selection
To achieve meaningful insights, the following structured approach was used:

### 1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure.
- Identified missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Performed data cleaning and transformation for better analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Statistical Summary**: Evaluated key statistics to understand distributions and trends.
- **Feature Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between variables impacting diabetes.
- **Data Visualization**: Used histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to uncover trends.
- **Class Distribution**: Assessed the balance between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

### 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Glucose Levels** – Key indicator for diabetes diagnosis.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)** – Evaluates obesity, a known diabetes risk factor.
- **Age Distribution** – Assesses risk variation across different age groups.
- **Insulin & Blood Pressure Levels** – Analyzes their impact on diabetes.
- **Pregnancies (for female patients)** – Evaluates pregnancy-related diabetes risk.

## Key Insights from the Analysis

### 1. Feature Importance & Correlations
- Higher **glucose levels** show a strong correlation with diabetes presence.
- **BMI and Age** are key contributing factors.
- Elevated **blood pressure and insulin levels** often associate with diabetes cases.
- Individuals with **more pregnancies** (for females) show a higher likelihood of diabetes.

### 2. Data Distribution & Trends
- A significant proportion of diabetic patients are found in the **higher BMI and glucose range**.
- **Age** is a crucial factor, with diabetes prevalence increasing among older individuals.
- Imbalanced class distribution in the dataset highlights the importance of handling bias in predictive modeling.
